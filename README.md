# smart-route

This application is an interactive route planner built with Streamlit, which allows users to plan routes by setting a starting point, destination, and optional waypoints on a map. The app integrates with the Google Maps API to retrieve and display route details, including the total distance and duration. Users can input locations manually or click directly on the map to set their points, and the app will dynamically update the route information. Additionally, users can reset markers or clear waypoints and destinations as needed.

Key features include:

Selection of starting location from a preset list or manual input.
Interactive map for setting start, destination, and waypoint locations.
Real-time route calculation and display using Google Maps API.
Ability to clear or reset markers on the map.
This tool is ideal for anyone needing to visualize and plan routes with multiple stops efficiently.
