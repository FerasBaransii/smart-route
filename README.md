# Smart-Route
Smart-Route is an interactive route planner built with Streamlit. It allows users to plan routes by setting a starting point, destination, and optional waypoints on a map. The app integrates with the Google Maps API to retrieve and display detailed route information, including the total distance and estimated duration. Users can input locations manually or click directly on the map to set their points, with the app dynamically updating the route.

## Key Features

- Interactive Map: Set start, destination, and waypoints interactively by clicking on the map.
Real-Time Route Calculation: Visualize routes with total distance and time using the Google Maps API.

This tool is ideal for users who need to efficiently visualize and plan routes with multiple stops.
